# Nydus Map Pool

This is a repository for submitting maps to the BE `mindustry.nydus.app:6566` server.<br>
To submit maps use the Pull Request feature of github or post them in the #map-submissions channel on the nydus discord by doing !map submit with the msav attached in #lunch-sfw.

### Rules:

1: Map has to be a `.msav` file.<br>
2: Filename must be the in-game name of the map.<br>
3: Map must have a description.<br>
4: No sandbox blocks unless its for the enemy attack team.<br>
5: Try to keep suggestions sensible.<br>
6: Preferably named like this: `gamemode_map-name.msav`

Feel free to add (or remove) maps via pull requests based solely on your own opinion,<br>
don't be afraid to offend people with your own taste :slightly_smiling_face:<br>
(discussing them can happen in the pull request)
